# Python Requirements for Jute Ribboning Machine Project
#
# This project is primarily a Node.js (frontend) + ESP32 (firmware) project.
# Python dependencies are only needed if you use PlatformIO for ESP32 development.
#
# PlatformIO itself is installed via pip:
# pip install platformio
#
# If you're using Arduino IDE instead, you don't need Python dependencies.
#
# Optional: If you add Python scripts for data analysis, testing, or automation,
# list those dependencies below:

# platformio>=6.0.0  # Uncomment if using PlatformIO CLI for ESP32 firmware
